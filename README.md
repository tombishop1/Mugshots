 A tool for creating staff photoboards. Simply populate the `data` folder with JPEG images, where the filename is the name of the person in the photo, and run the script `src/makefile.R`. You may need to adjust the layout options on line 11 depending on the number of images you have. By default, this creates an A3 sized pdf in the `output` folder.
